# Contribute

I welcome constributions to this project, especially:

1. Additional objective (smoothing) functions
2. Additional constraints
3. Default weight computation for objectives and constraints work well for distributions with ranges from 1 to 1e6. However, the default weights on do not work well for distributions with very small or large ranges. Solutions to this problem are welcome.
